ONStools is a set of scripts designed to simplify the deployment and testing of Cisco's ONS 15454 SONET/DWDM platform. 

These scripts are all written using the Python programming language. The scripts all make use of a common ONS class for communicating with the Cisco ONS platform. Each script also makes use of a common set of CLI parameters as follows:

-s <shelf #>	If this is a multishelf system, specify the shelf the card is in.
-l <slot #>	Specific the slot the card is in
-u <username>	Username used to access the ONS shelf
-d <password>	Password used to access the ONS shelf
