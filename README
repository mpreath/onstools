ONStools is a python class and set of python scripts designed to simplify the deployment and testing of Cisco's ONS 15XXX SONET/DWDM platform. 

These scripts are all written using the Python programming language. The scripts all make use of a common ONS class for communicating with the Cisco ONS platform. Each script also makes use of a common set of CLI parameters as follows:

-s <shelf #>	If this is a multishelf system, specify the shelf the card is in.
-l <slot #>	Specific the slot the card is in
-h <hostname>   Hostname or IP address of ONS shelf
-u <username>	Username used to access the ONS shelf
-p <password>	Password used to access the ONS shelf

discover.py - a script that displays all of the nodes connected to the node being logged into.

discover.py -h <ip address> -u <username> -p <password>
-h				IP address of the ONs shelf being accessed.
-u              Username used to access the ONS shelf.
-p             	Password used to access the ONS shelf.

inventory.py - a script that connects to all nodes in the network and collects inventories from them - storing them in seperate folders

inventory.py -h <ip address> -u <username> -p <password> 
-h				IP address of the ONs shelf being accessed.
-u              Username used to access the ONS shelf.
-p             	Password used to access the ONS shelf.

xpconfig.pl - a script for setting SVLANs, protection, port configuration, and few other features on Cisco's XPonder card (20x1G and 2x10G versions)

xpconfig.pl [-p] [-m] -v <range> [-s <shelf #>] -l <slot #> -t <type> -u <username> -d <password> <ip address>
-p	This option indicates that the VLANs are protected.
-m	This option indicates the XP card is the master for protection.
-v <range>	Specify the range of VLANs to provision on the card.
		(example: 1-5,10,15,20,25-40)
-s <shelf #>	If this is a multishelf system, specify the shelf the card is in.
-l <slot #>	Specify the slot the card is in.
-t <type>	Specify type of card. Either 10g or ge.
-u <username>	Username used to access the ONS shelf.
-d <password>	Password used to access the ONS shelf.
<ip address>	IP Address of the ONS shelf being accessed.

[not available] dsxloop.rb - a script for setting up loopbacks on the DS1 and DS3 cards for testing purposes. 

dsxloop.rb [-s <shelf #>] -l <slot #> -t <type> -u <username> -d <password> [-r] <ip address>
-s <shelf #>	If this is a multishelf system, specify the shelf the card is in.
-l <slot #>	Specify the slot the card is in.
-t <type>	Specify type of card. (ds1-14,ds1-56,ds3-12, or ds3-48)
-u <username>	Username used to access the ONS shelf.
-d <password>	Password used to access the ONS shelf.
-r		Use to remove the loopback and put the ports to IS-AINS
<ip address>	IP Address of the ONS shelf being accessed.
